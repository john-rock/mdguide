Welcome to this guide on creating guides! This meta-guide will teach you how to create your own step-by-step documentation using WriterX's guide platform.

## Understanding the Guide Structure

Every guide in WriterX lives in its own directory under `app/guides/(content)/`. Each guide is a single MDX file with YAML frontmatter and markdown content.

The basic structure looks like this:
```
app/guides/(content)/
  └── your-guide-name/
      └── page.mdx
```

The `(content)` part is a Next.js route group - it keeps your guides organized without affecting the URL structure. Your guide will be accessible at `/your-guide-name`.

## Setting Up Your Guide File

Create a new directory for your guide and add a `page.mdx` file. The file must start with YAML frontmatter wrapped in triple dashes:

```yaml
---
title: Your Guide Title
description: A brief description of what readers will learn
author: Your Name
date: 2025-10-31
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
published: true
---
```

**Important fields:**
- `title` (required): The guide's main heading
- `description` (required): Shows in search results and guide listings
- `published` (required): Must be `true` for the guide to appear
- `author` (optional): Attribution information
- `date` (optional): Publication or update date
- `tags` (optional): Array of tags for filtering and categorization

## Writing Your First Step

After the frontmatter, you can add an introduction paragraph (like the one at the top of this guide). Then, create your first step using a level-2 heading:

```markdown
## Your First Step Title

Write the content for this step here. You can use:
- Bullet points
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks
```

## Adding Code Examples

Code blocks are essential for technical guides. Use triple backticks with a language identifier:

````markdown
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
````

This renders with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

Supported languages include JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, bash, JSON, YAML, and many more.

## Using Markdown Features

WriterX supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). Here are some useful features:

**Lists:**
- Unordered lists use `-`, `*`, or `+`
- Ordered lists use numbers
- You can nest lists with indentation

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
```

**Blockquotes:**
```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> It can span multiple lines
```

**Inline code:**
Use single backticks for `inline code` references.

## Organizing Multiple Steps

Each `##` heading creates a new step. The content between two headings becomes that step's content. Plan your guide structure like this:

1. Introduction (before first `##`)
2. Step 1 - Basic concept
3. Step 2 - Building on basics
4. Step 3 - Advanced topics
5. Step 4 - Best practices

The sidebar automatically numbers your steps and provides navigation. Users can click steps or use the URL hash format `#step-N` to jump to specific sections.

## Testing Your Guide

Before publishing, test your guide locally:

1. Save your `page.mdx` file
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/your-guide-name`
4. Check that:
   - Frontmatter renders correctly
   - All steps appear in the sidebar
   - Code blocks have syntax highlighting
   - Links work properly
   - Progress tracking functions

## Building for Production

When you're ready to publish:

1. Set `published: true` in your frontmatter
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate static paths
3. The build process will:
   - Parse all guides
   - Generate static pages
   - Build the search index
   - Validate your MDX syntax

If the build fails, check the console for errors. Common issues:
- Missing required frontmatter fields
- Invalid YAML syntax
- Unclosed code blocks
- Invalid MDX syntax

## Advanced: How the System Works

Behind the scenes, WriterX processes your guide through several stages:

**Content Processing Pipeline:**
1. `app/lib/guides/loader.ts` - Reads your MDX file from the filesystem
2. `app/lib/guides/parser.ts` - Parses frontmatter and extracts steps from `##` headings
3. `app/lib/guides/search.ts` - Indexes your content for full-text search

**Step Extraction:**
- Step IDs are auto-generated by slugifying heading text
- Only `##` headings become steps (not `#` or `###`)
- Steps are numbered from 1 in the UI (0-indexed internally)

**Progress Tracking:**
- Uses localStorage to persist progress across sessions
- URL hash (`#step-N`) takes precedence for shareability
- Scroll spy highlights the active step in the sidebar

## Tips and Best Practices

**Writing Effective Steps:**
- Keep each step focused on one concept
- Use descriptive heading names
- Include code examples where relevant
- Test all code samples

**SEO and Discoverability:**
- Write clear, descriptive titles
- Use relevant tags
- Include searchable keywords in descriptions
- Link between related guides

**Content Organization:**
- Start with prerequisites if needed
- Build complexity gradually
- End with next steps or related resources
- Keep steps roughly equal in length

## Common Pitfalls

**Guide not appearing?**
- Verify `published: true` in frontmatter
- Ensure file is named `page.mdx` (not `guide.mdx` or anything else)
- Check that the directory is under `app/guides/(content)/`
- Run `npm run build` to regenerate paths

**Steps not parsing?**
- Only `##` headings work, not `#` or `###`
- Ensure there's a space after the `##`
- Check for proper heading syntax

**Search not working?**
- The search index builds on first API request
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify your content has searchable text

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to create guides, try:
- Creating your first guide on a topic you know well
- Experimenting with different markdown features
- Reviewing the source of this guide as an example
- Checking out other guides for inspiration

The best way to learn is by doing. Start with a simple guide and iterate based on feedback. Happy writing!
