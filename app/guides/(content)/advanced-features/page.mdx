## Custom Hooks

Learn how to create custom hooks to extend functionality.

Custom hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic across your application. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(c => c - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);

  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Optimize your application for better performance.

There are several techniques you can use:
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Memoization
- Virtual scrolling

Each technique serves different use cases and can significantly improve user experience.

## State Management

Implement advanced state management patterns.

For complex applications, consider using state management libraries like:
- Redux
- Zustand
- Jotai
- Recoil

Choose the one that best fits your application's needs.

## Testing Strategies

Write comprehensive tests for your application.

A good testing strategy includes:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Visual regression tests

```javascript
describe('Counter', () => {
  it('should increment count', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());
    act(() => result.current.increment());
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
  });
});
```
