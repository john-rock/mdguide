## Introduction

Welcome to the getting started guide! This guide will walk you through the basics of using our platform.

In this step, you'll learn about:
- The core concepts
- How to navigate the interface
- Basic terminology

Let's get started!

## Installation

First, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install writerx
```

Once installed, you can verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
writerx --version
```

You should see the version number printed to the console.

## Configuration

Now that you have everything installed, let's configure your environment.

Create a new file called `writerx.config.js` in your project root:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: 'default',
  plugins: [],
  settings: {
    autoSave: true,
    darkMode: false
  }
};
```

This configuration file allows you to customize the behavior of your application.

## Your First Project

Let's create your first project! Follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project
2. Initialize the project with `writerx init`
3. Start the development server

Here's what the initialization looks like:

```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
writerx init
```

The CLI will guide you through some setup questions. Accept the defaults for now.

## Running the Development Server

To see your project in action, start the development server:

```bash
writerx dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your project running!

The development server includes:
- Hot module replacement
- Error overlay
- Fast refresh
